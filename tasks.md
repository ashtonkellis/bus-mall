# STRETCH GOALS
* Handle the display and voting for an arbitrary number of images
* Using a variable, declare in your JS how many images to show
* Based on that value, dynamically create that many ```<img>``` tags
* Also based on that value, ensure that your randomizer is properly handling the specified number of images for display and repeat tracking.
