# HOUSEKEEPING
- Do today's work on a branch called `chartjs`.
- Using ChartJS, display your vote totals in a bar chart as instructed in the initial definition of the BusMall assignment. If you want to try some additional chart types, do so with some of your alternate data that you have calculated from your vote results. The size and look of your chart is up to you, just be sure to put it in the area beneath the three images. Hint: for this type of data, bar charts work well.

* Handle the display and voting for an arbitrary number of images
* Using a variable, declare in your JS how many images to show
* Based on that value, dynamically create that many ```<img>``` tags
* Also based on that value, ensure that your randomizer is properly handling the specified number of images for display and repeat tracking.
