# BusMall User Stories

* As a developer, I want to practice my skills at writing clean code, and using the design techniques that i've learned to make a website that is pleasing to look at.

* As a voter on products (aka, a user of the site), I would like to see something that doesn't look terrible, and is intuitive to use and free of bugs.

* As a product marketing type person, I would like to be able to view the total number of clicks that each item receives, and the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was show.

* As a prospective employer of one Ashton K Ellis I would like to see well written code, and a git commit history that is free of swearing and consists of useful messages.

* As a non-technical mother of one Ashton K Ellis, I would like to be impressed with the website that my son inevitably sends me. I would like ther eto be fancy color changing when i mouse over buttons, becuase I think that this is extremely impressive and much harder to code than it actually is.

* As the person grading Ashton's lab assignment I would like to see urls that are free to leading slashes for once. I would like to see code that is logically organized, and uses the techniques that we have been learning (constructor functions, etc).

* As a person who loves fun, i would like there to be at minimum one easter egg in the site. (TBD)
